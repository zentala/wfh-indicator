# Would you use this? A physical LED status light for your door when working from home

**TL;DR**: LED ring (or old phone) on your door showing if you're on a call, focused, or free. Reduces awkward interruptions and family tension.

## The problem I'm trying to solve

When working from home with flatmates/family, people don't know when you're:

- On an important call
- Focused and need quiet
- Available to chat

This leads to:

- Interruptions during meetings (embarrassing)
- Family feeling guilty and avoiding you completely
- You feeling bad about setting boundaries
- Lost productivity and relationship strain

## My solution: WFH Indicator

Simple LED ring mounted on your door with color codes:

- ðŸ”´ **Red**: On call, don't disturb
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Video call (less strict)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Focused work
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Come on in!

**Interactive**: Button on the outside lets people "ask" if they can enter. You can respond by changing the color from your computer.

## Two versions I'm considering

1. **Hardware**: ESP32 + LED ring + button (~$20 in parts)
2. **Phone**: Old smartphone with always-on display + car phone holder as mount (free if you have an old phone)

The phone version could even use AI to detect when someone approaches and make the status more visible.

## Why this isn't just for "weird" people

Offices already solved this:

- Meeting rooms have booking displays
- Open offices have status lights
- Even headphones became "do not disturb" signals

This just brings that clarity home. Your bedroom office deserves the same respect as a boardroom.

## Current status

I've got the concept, interaction design, and app architecture planned. But I need help with:

- ESP32 firmware
- 3D printed cases
- Testing with real families

## The ask

Would you actually use something like this?

I'm planning to open-source the whole thing because I can't finish it alone, but I think it could genuinely help people. Especially now that remote work is permanent for many of us.

What do you think? Too niche or actually useful?
