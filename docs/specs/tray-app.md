  - Custom time blocks for recurring activities
- Settings of WFH Indicator device
  - (Multi-)Device pairing

  - Remote device settings control
- Notification preferences
  - Silent mode during audio calls (microphone on or screen sharing)
  - Visual-only mode during screen sharing - tray icon flashing only
- Startup options (launch on system start)

## Security & Privacy

- Local-only communication (no cloud dependency)
- Authentication token system for secure device pairing
- Encrypted connection between tray app and indicator devices

## Network Configuration

- WebSocket server for indicator device communication
- Configurable port settings (to avoid conflicts with other applications)
- IP discovery mechanisms:
  - Broadcasting service (regularly announces app presence on network)
  - Response to polling requests from indicator devices

## Device Communication

The tray app communicates with devices using the same WebSocket protocol. Different device types display information according to their capabilities:

**WFH Indicators (door-mounted devices):**
- **[Mobile App](./mobile-app.md)**: Full status display with text, calendar integration, touch interactions
- **[LED Ring](./led-indicator.md)**: Color-only display, button interactions, battery reporting

**Status Display Plugins (smart home integrations):**
- **Home Assistant**: Status display on dashboards, automations
- **Smart Mirrors**: Read-only status display (no "Ask to Enter" support)
- **Mobile Widgets**: Remote status viewing anywhere in home

For detailed network communication strategy, see [Network Communication Strategy](./network-communication.md).

## Device Pairing

- Guided pairing wizard for new devices
- QR code generation for mobile app pairing
- USB/UART connection support for LED indicator pairing
