## üíª Development Setup

To get started with the development of the WFH Indicator tray app, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1.  **Fork and Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/wfh-indicator.git
    cd wfh-indicator/tray-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the App in Development Mode**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Electron app with hot-reloading enabled.

4.  **Run Tests**

    To run the unit tests:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    To run the E2E tests (once the environment issue is resolved):

    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e
    ```

## ü§ù How to Contribute

1.  **Choose a project** from the list above that matches your skills.
2.  **Read the specifications** in `/docs/specs/` for technical details.
3.  **Open an issue** to discuss your planned contribution.
4.  **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
5.  **Make your changes** and ensure all tests pass.
6.  **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch.

### Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `package.json` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
